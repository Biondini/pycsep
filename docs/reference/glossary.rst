Terms and Definitions
=====================

The page contains terms and their definitions (and possible mathematical definitions) that have precise meanings within the CSEP universe.

.. _stochastic-event-set:

Stochastic Event Set
--------------------
Collection of synthetic earthquake catalogs that are produced by an earthquake forecast.
A *stochastic event set* consists of *N* synthetic catalogs that represent different realizations for the same forecast.

.. _earthquake_forecast:

Earthquake Forecast
-------------------
A probabilistic statement about the occurrence of an earthquake that can include information about the magnitude and spatial
location. CSEP supports earthquake forecasts specified as the expected rate of an event in disjoint space and magnitude bins,
and as families of synthetic earthquake catalogs.

.. _time-dependent-forecast:

Time-dependent Forecast
-----------------------

.. _time-independent-forecast:

Time-independent Forecast
-------------------------
