Terms and Definitions
=====================

The page contains terms and their definitions (and possible mathematical definitions) that have precise meanings within the CSEP universe.

.. _stochastic-event-set:

Stochastic Event Set
--------------------
Collection of synthetic earthquakes (events) that are produced by an earthquake.
A *stochastic event set* consists of *N* events that represent a continuous representation of seismicity that can sample
the uncertainty present within in the forecasting model.

.. _earthquake_forecast:

Earthquake Forecast
-------------------
A probabilistic statement about the occurrence of seismicity that can include information about the magnitude and spatial
location. CSEP supports earthquake forecasts expressed as the expected rate of seismicity in disjoint space and magnitude bins
and as families of synthetic earthquake catalogs.

.. _time-dependent-forecast:

Time-dependent Forecast
-----------------------

.. _time-independent-forecast:

Time-independent Forecast
-------------------------
Forecasts can either be
