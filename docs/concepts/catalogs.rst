Catalogs
========

PyCSEP provides some routines for working with and manipulating earthquake catalogs for the purposes of evaluating earthquake
forecasting models. If you are able to make use of these tools for other reasons, please let us know!

We are especially interested in including basic catalog statistics into this package. If you are interested in helping
implement routines like b-value estimation and catalog completeness please let us know!
