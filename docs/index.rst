CSEP: Toolkit for Earthquake Forecast Developers
================================================

*The CSEP tools help earthquake forecast model developers evaluate their forecasts with the goal of understanding
earthquake predictability.*


1. Help modelers become familiar with formats, procedures, and evaluations used in CSEP Testing Centers.
2. Provide vetted software for model developers to use in their research.
3. Quantative and visual tools to assess earthquake forecast quality.
4. Promote open-science ideas by ensuring transparency and availability of scientific code and results.
5. Curate benchmark models and data sets for modelers to conduct retrospective experiments of their forecasts.

The CSEP toolkit provides the following modules:

1. **Data Models**
2. **Evaluations**
3. **Graphics**
4. **Utilities**

The toolkit helps enforce the following traits:

+ *Reproducible*
+ *Transparent*
+ *Accessible*
+ *Extensible*
+ *Interoperable*
