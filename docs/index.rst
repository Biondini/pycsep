Collaboratory for the Study of Earthquake Predictability
========================================================

The goal of CSEP is to develop a virtual, distributed laboratory-a collaboratory-that can support a wide range of scientific prediction experiments in multiple regional or global natural laboratories. This earthquake system science approach seeks to provide answers to the questions: (1) How should scientific prediction experiments be conducted and evaluated? and (2) What is the intrinsic predictability of the earthquake rupture process?

A major focus of CSEP is to develop international collaborations between the regional testing centers and to accommodate a wide-ranging set of prediction experiments involving geographically distributed fault systems in different tectonic environments.

CSEP is supported by the United States Geological Survey, the National Science Foundation, the W. M. Keck Foundation and the United States Geological Survey.
