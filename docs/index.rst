Collaboratory for the Study of Earthquake Predictability
========================================================

This package represents the collection of code required to conduct CSEP experiments within testing-centers. The code is model
agnostic and represents a general framework that can be extended based on individual user requirements.

The package will provide easy access to routines so that researchers do not need to implement their own versions of standard CSEP tests.
